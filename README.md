- Maven 3.8+
- MySQL (or your preferred database)
- Git
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

---

## üîß Backend Setup (Spring Boot with JWT Authentication)

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Configure the database** in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SilverHarvest
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=Ijse@1234
   
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   
   # JWT configuration
   jwt.secret=MySecretKeyForJWTGenerationMySecretKey
   jwt.expiration=86400000
   ```

3. **Build and run the backend**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **The backend will be available at**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/
   ```

---

## üé® Frontend Setup (Bootstrap + jQuery)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**, or use a local server such as **Live Server** in VS Code to run the frontend.

- Store the token in `localStorage` on the frontend:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem("jwtToken", response.token);
  ```

- Attach the token in all API requests:
  ```javascript
  $.ajax({
      url: "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/endpoint",
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
          "Authorization": "Bearer " + localStorage.getItem("jwtToken")
      },
      success: function(data) {
          console.log(data);
      }
  });
  ```

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

1. **Start the backend**:
